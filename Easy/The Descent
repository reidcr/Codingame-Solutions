//
// The purpose of this program is to simulate an environment where mountains need to
// be destroyed before Kirk and Spock's starship can land, and the mountains must be
// destroyed before the starship hits them. Algorithm:
//
// 1. The entirety of the program takes place over an infinite loop.
//    A. Variables representing the mountain to be fired upon and the number of
//      mountains are declared.
//    B. Inputs the height of each mountain and calculates the largest height.
//      Sets the index of the mountain corresponding to this height.
//    C. Outputs the index of the mountain to be fired upon, which is the
//      mountain of the highest height once all mountain heights have been input.
//    D. Loop repeats until all mountains are gone.
//

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define NUMMT 8     // number of mountains to fire upon

/**
 * The while loop represents the game.
 * Each iteration represents a turn of the game
 * where you are given inputs (the heights of the mountains)
 * and where you have to print an output (the index of the mountain to fire on)
 * The inputs you are given are automatically updated according to your last actions.
